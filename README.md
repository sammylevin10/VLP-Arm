# VLP-Arm
Project files for a 3D printed scale replica of a museum artifact with capacitive touch points that trigger audio experiences for blind or low vision visitors
- One touch point on the peg that connects the arm to the rest of the body, which triggers a spoken narration
- One touch point on the thumb, which triggers a Gregorian chant
